      <p>For this prototype, I explored the storytelling concept of the project. The user I had was a bit confused what was
      clickable. So I thought of possibly having hover over interactions to reveal other information during the story. I also
      thought of including a call to action in the end because the user was confused when the story ended.</p>

      <p>For this iteration, I added more animation components to the prototype. I did this by cutting out shapes and moving them myself
      when users interacted with the prototype. I also added a petition at the end of the story as a call to action. It received positive
    feedback because the users felt like they could contribute to the cause.</p>
