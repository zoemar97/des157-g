      <h2>Meet An Immigrant</h2>

      <p>In this website it features a more story like perspective of immigrants. The main purpose is to showcase the variety of immigrants throughout the united states whether they immigrated recently or their family history of immigration. This
        site has a better user experience in comparison to the previous site I referenced. The home page displays featured stories and images of folks who classify themselves as immigrants. It also has a call to action in the upper right corner,
        allowing users to donate to maintain the website in order to spread awareness. I like how personal the experience is narrated throughout the website. User’s are able to share their own story and purpose for coming to united states. In a way,
        it shows how everyone has a different retrospect and meaning of what it means to immigrate to the united states. The interface is also fairly easy to navigate although it does feature a hamburger menu. But the menu is clearly laid out in a
        likely manner once it’s opened. It opens up the possibilities that are offered on the website such as the “sharing stories” aspect. I also thought it was interesting how they created their own filter for others to use in their facebook
        profile pictures. Allowing users to show the diversity within immigrants around the U.S. This website overall offers everything that the site above lacked in the perspective of creating a more personal experience. I hope to integrate a
        similar, but more interactive way for users to gain a greater understanding of what is going on around the border. Sharing the stories and facts of the impact of our current president on the current immigrants fleeing central american
        countries. While shifting the narrative for others to see resilience rather than focusing on the atrocity of the “wall”.

      <h2>Migrant Caravan Map</h2>

      <p>For my topic brainstorm I focused on the aspects of immigration/migration current events. As I looked around the internet, I remembered about the caravan movement from central america to north america. I want to focus on creating awareness
        for what is going on around or near the border, since the news is centered around the building of the wall. The experience for this is simple. The route taken by the caravan is outlined with a black path using google maps API. The map
        interaction is limited to clicks and zooming into the map. It offers simple functionality. Each point is mapped from a to x so far. The mapped points can be clicked on to reveal the size of the caravan, article sources, and sometimes quotes
        are shown if there’s any available. In my own perspective, the website lacks in its user interface. It’s too simple and only offers an outline of information regarding the caravan. It would be interesting to see more of a personal outlook of
        the what is going on based on user input. Maybe a form for people in the surrounding areas to give updates of what is truly going on in the front line. The interface focuses a lot on the information/news of what is happening. In comparison
        to the site below, it needs a call to action because the migrants are in need of resources as simple as food and shelter. More resources are needed as a way for others around the world to assist the migrants themselves to meet their basic
        needs. This website overall, allows users to gain a greater perspective of the journey for the caravan towards the north, but lacks the personal perspective and tools to aid folks. I was intrigued as how they used the google API as I am
        interested in mapping immigrants journeys and struggles based on the detainment of immigrant children around the border.</p>
